    <h1>How can music affect your lifestyle?</h1>
    <p>Music has a huge influence in how someone can think, both positive and negative. I can tell by my experience, I used to be a sad teenager, then when i found an artistc which used to make depressed songs, I fell in luv for his songs, but I couldn't realize
        that it was his songs that were like reminding me i'm a trash, and that's not a true fact. When you begin to listen songs that give you a good and happier vibe, you tend to get better and better. It's kinda weird to say I used to be
        that bro who was always complaining about how garbage was life and world, always speaking things like "I wish I could end me now", shout out to Lil Uzi vert, the bro who changed me completely, no more suicidal speakings, only hapiness and
        a healthier thinking about life. It's a very unique and good experience, everyone might try that, it's hard path to take, to avoid songs you identify yourself and you get sad cuz that. No more sadness, we can all find a way to overcome even our 
        worst nightmares!
